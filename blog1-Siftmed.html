        This first entry will be for a school project; My Industry Seminar Article for Researching and Highlighting a lesser-known company. Keep in mind, i'm not affiliated with or endorsing my chosen company.
        So who have I chosen? <strong>SiftMed.</strong> SiftMed is both the company name and their product - An Artifical Intelligence processing software that organizes, categorizes, and analyzes medical files. They 
        claim their mission is to help find items in people's medical data that could change their lives. In their own words, "To uncover facts that change lives". They say their software can cut review times down by 50% for medical
        notes and data. Which of course would be a great help for many people, civillians and medical workers alike. After all, these records are often thrown about in the average home or office, facts can get missed because of duplicate files
        and handwritten text being illegible. In terms of what they're looking for in possible employees, they need people who: 
        <ul>
            <li>can build and maintain modern web applications with react and javascript</li>
            <li>have experience with Amazon Web Services (AWS) like lambda and S3</li>
            <li>have proficiency with languages like python, Java, and PHP</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        It's clear these are very essential skills to have for SiftMed, considering their software and website run on and use react.js and likely AWS EC2. EC2 uses python so that'll come in handy. SiftMed seems to keep a lot of their inner workings
        underwrap, understandably, so I can only assume that like ChatGPT, their AI runs on PyTorch, a deep learning framework comprised of python. However, their job listings state a need of 5-8 years experience in the tech field. So if you're a junior,
        maybe give a look back at them in a few years. Gives you plenty of time to hone your skills in the meantime, through continued school, freenlance work, and other job oppurtunities. They also require experience in NoSQL, data lakes/warehouses, MongoDB, and
        the likewise. You might be asking, "What are some ways I can learn more in between classes and work?". Hobbies and projects, my friend. For javascript and react, why not make your own website? Make a blog, or a website that does just has a button that
        displays a random image. You can look for resources like <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> for Java and MongoDB. There's all sorts of things you can make with python, aswell. There's plenty of people making amazing little
        programs for every use you can think of. Maybe visit <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dougdoug">DougDoug</a>, a personal favourite of mine, his videos could give you an idea of what you could come up with. Check out places like Stack Overflow or specific
        communities on Reddit as well, they are both chock full of veteran developers whose whole deal is sharing knowledge with others. By the time you've gone through all this, I'm sure you'll fit the requirements for SiftMed.
