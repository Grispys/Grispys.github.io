        <p>My Name is Matthew Verge. I am a student at Keyin College, studying software development. A junior programmer in a multitude of languages, intermediate knowledge of Python, Javascript, HTML/React, and GDscript.
            Junior knowledge in C++ thanks to my projects in Arduino. Visit my <a href="projects.html">projects</a> page to see some of them!

           <p>This here is a (<a id="youtube"href="https://www.youtube.com/c/grisp" target="blank">Youtube Channel</a>) I started way back in 2018, that exploded in success during the Covid pandemic, reaching 20k subscribers
            and over 14 million channel views. I learned a great deal of video editing and audio work, all self taught. I've only improved since!
           </p>

            I regularly attend Game Jams, digital events where thousands are given a time period and a theme, with the goal to make
            a full game at the end.
