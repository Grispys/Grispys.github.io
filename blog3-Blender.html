            Along with the 2D game i'm developing, I also have a 3D project on the burner. I flip between the two semi-frequently, but have been finding myself
            spending more time with the third dimension. With 3D games, it's not like a 2D game where - even if you've never made a sprite before - it's to pick up a paint program
            and get started. With 3D, you need to either take a good look at the free assets online, or make your own. Of course, even with the incredibly intuitive programs
            we have nowadays, modelling softwares like Blender are chock full of confusing terminology and thousands of buttons. A steep learning curve indeed, but it's one
            I need to navigate. <br>

            With one or two tutorials that covered the bare bone mechanics and keybinds/shortcuts, I had what I needed to get started. I've made chairs, tables, 
            bathtubs and sinks, and most recently a couch. It's fun, and theraputic. Sometimes when programming gets slow or I hit a wall, I swap over to blender and just make
            whatever I think I could use in the game. Might not be the greatest solution as I can't just work <i>only</i> on the parts I enjoy, it certainly keeps me motivated.
            At the very least, I'm still working as a whole.
