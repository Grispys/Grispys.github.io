            <P>I've made my fair share of games in Godot, with a couple I plan on releasing some day. Here's some previews of those games.</P>

            <h1>Automatic Chopsticks with Arduino</h1>
            <p>This here is a very early version of "Automatic Chopsticks" I had made. It used a laser range finder and a servo motor to detect when food entered range and would clamp down with the chopsticks. 
                It uses an Arduino Nano, and was my first experience with soldering.
