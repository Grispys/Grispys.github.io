            <p>Here is a little video preview into a something i'm working on in Godot, using GDScript. This game is a passion project that I put a solid chunk of my free time into.</p>

            <h1>Automatic Chopsticks with Arduino</h1>
            <p>This here is a very early version of "Automatic Chopsticks" I had made. It used a laser range finder and a servo motor to detect when food entered range and would clamp down with the chopsticks. 
                It uses an Arduino Nano, and was my first experience with soldering.
