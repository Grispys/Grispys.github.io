		<h1>WHY PLAY THIS FORMAT?</h1>
		<h2>because 4-5 player commander matches take way too long.
			so i made a new format<br>that tries to include more people, but take less time.
		</h2>
		<br>
		<h1>PLAY RULES/MODIFIERS</h1>
		<p>This is a unique format, being commander based and team centered, with two teams of
			three players. Each player will build a 30 card deck, with 1 commander of their choice
			and 29 singletons, and each team has a starting life of 50. Commander Damage is still
			available, with changes being that the max is now 30, and it stacks with each commander.<br><br> As a game begins, each player is randomly assigned with one another.
			They then shuffle their decks into one large library consisting of 87 cards, excluding their commanders.
			This unique style of play allows for some funny interactions. I.e, you can only put one copy of Counterspell into your
			deck, but there's 3 decks, all containing a Counterspell - which means at any given point, there's three copies in
			your library.
		</p>
		<p>To decide which team goes first, each team rolls 3 d6's. Higher goes first. All three players of a team
			take their turns at the same time; untap, upkeep, main, combat, post main, end. <br><br>To quickly explain
			how this affects standard play, here are the base rules:<br><br></p>

				<h1>NEW AND ALTERED RULES:</h1>
			<p>
			Each player may play one land per turn (Three per team turn!)<br><br>
			Each player may look at and use spells from their teammates hands.<br><br>
			Each player controls every permanent that their teammate places.<br><br>
			The Legend Rule still applies. (Each player has a unique commander)<br><br>

			<span class ="underline">Players cannot take extra turns. (Extra phases ARE allowed)</span><br><br>
			<span class ="underline">Players cannot search their libraries. </span>
			<br><br> Yeah, big rule change. Tough luck. There's three of you, and 90 cards to go around.
			<br><br>
			<span class ="underline">Players cannot use WUBRG commanders.</span>
			<br><br> Another tough rule. If you want access to all the colours, have your teammates use different coloured decks.
			<br>This format is about working together!

			<br><br> If a team controls all three of their commanders, they get a special emblem named "Unity",
			<br>which has <br><br>"Spells of your commander's colours cost (1) less to cast.<br> Spells your opponents cast of your commander's colours cost (1) more to cast."
				<br><br><br><br><br><br> These are subject to change!
