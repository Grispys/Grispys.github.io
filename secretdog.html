        <p>Corndogs are more than you think they are. You may worry about your worthfulness in the fleeting "beauty" that is life. Everyone has reached a point in their life where they stop
            and truly question "why?". Not to anything in particular, but rather to specifically, everything.
            <br/>
            Why is it so hard to make friends after college? Why does it feel like time is passing faster the older you become? 
            <br/><br/>
            These questions become redundant when you think about them. You have lost friends, family, and ideas. 
            <br/>You have lost hope in many aspects of life, and yet you push on. Why is that?
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>Why, if it is so easy to give in to all the easy ways out, do so many people trudge through the no-longer-imaginary cacotopia that is the Earth? 
            <br/>
            This site will offer no answer. Even now, it would seem like this space of text on a screen is doing naught but filling your head with negative emotions. The answer to life's most
            grueling questions, about human conflict, the disgusting behaviour of some people on the planet. 
            <br/>
            <br/>Humans can take complete 180 nosedives in opinions, hide their true motives their entire lives.
            <br/>
            What of me? Am I simply reguritating more of the same said by all, views widely agreed upon that determine what is wrong? Perhaps.
            <br/>
            You're not going to find what you're looking for here; on a page written by a person with so little experience in life, who claims to have been thrust into emotional maturity earlier than expected.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
            However, at the end of the day, not finding what you want on this website might be a good thing. This corn dog experience might provide what you need, instead.
