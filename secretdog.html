        <p>Corndogs are more than you think they are. They may very well be all you need.
            <br><br>
            You will not find the answers to the hard hitting questions you have such as "Why do some people hurt others?", or "Why is there war?", and anything from what your purpose is to how
            they fit all that toothpaste into such a tiny tube thingy.
            <br><br>
            Someday, you will die.<br> Someday, this website will sit decrepit in the vaults of github long after humans are no longer there to maintain it. Although clich√© to say, there is beauty
            in the fragility and ephemeral nature of life.
            <br><br>
            Simply stating this may not be enough to get you out of the dumps, and that's okay. At the end of the day, you have to decide whether it's
            worth it to forge on. But while this corndog simulator may not be what you want at the moment, it may be what you need; a small preview that someone out there will always be trying to
            entertain despite the state of the world. 

            <br><br><br><br>
            That, without argument, is beautiful.
